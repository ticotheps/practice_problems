"""
INSERTION SORT

Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a sorted version
of that array. Use the insertion sort algorithm to sort the array.

- Sample Input: [8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]
- Sample Output: [2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9] 

- Hints:
    - Divide the input array into two subarrays in place.
    - The first subarray should be sorted at all times and should start with a
      length of 1.
    - The second subarray should be unsorted.
    - Iterate through the unsorted subarray, inserting all of its elements into
      the sorted subarray in the correct position by swapping them into place.
    - Eventually, the entire array will be sorted.
