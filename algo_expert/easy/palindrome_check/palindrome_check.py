"""
PALINDROME CHECK

Write a function that takes in a non-empty string and that returns a boolean
representing whether the string is a palindrome. A palindrome is defined as "a
string that's written the same forward and backward. 

Note: Single character strings ARE palindromes.

Sample Input: "abcdcba"
Sample Output: "True"

Hints:
    - Start by building the input string in reverse order and comparing this
    newly built string to the input string.
    - Can you optimize your algorithm by using recursion? What are the
    implications of recursion on an algorithm's space-time complexity analysis?
    - Go back to an iterative solution and try using pointers to solve this
    problem: start with a pointer at the first index of the string and a pointer
    at the final index of the string. What can you do from there?
