Find Closest Value in BST (Binary Search Tree)

You are given a BST data structure consisting of BST nodes.

Each node has an integer value stored in a property called "value" and
two children nodes stored in properties called "left" and "right,"
respectively.

A node is said to be a BST node if and ONLY IF it satisfies the BST
property: 
  - its value is strictly GREATER THAN the values of every node to
    its left.
  - its value is LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO the values of every node to
    its right. 
  - both of its children nodes are either BST nodes themselves
    or None (null) values.

You are also given a target integer value.

Write a function that finds the closest value to that target value 
contained in the BST.

Assume that there will only be one closest value.
