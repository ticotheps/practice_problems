BINARY SEARCH

Write a function that takes in a sorted array of integers, as well as a target
integer. The function should use the Binary Search Algorithm to determine if the
target integer is contained in the array and should return its index if it is,
otherwise -1.

UNDERSTAND PHASE:

Objective: 
    - Create an algorithm that takes in two inputs (an array of sorted
    integers and an integer representing a "target" value) and returns a single
    output (an integer; either the index of the target value in the array or
    -1).
    
Defining Terms:
    - "Binary Search":
        - An algorithm that can search through a sorted list of items to find a
        target value with an O(log n) run time complexity.
