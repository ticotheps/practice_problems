Depth-First Search

You are given a 'Node' class that has a name and an array of optional
children Nodes. When put together, Nodes form a simple tree-like
structure.

Implement the 'depthFirstSearch()' method on the 'Node' class, which
takes in an empty array, traverses the tree using the Depth-First Search
approach (specifically navigating the tree from left to right), stores
all of the Nodes' names in the input array, and returns it.

Sample Input:

                        A 
                      / | \
                     B  C  D
                    / \   / \
                   E   F G   H
                      / \ \
                     I   J K

Sample Output: ["A", "B", "E", "F", "I", "J", "C", "D", "G", "K", "H"]
