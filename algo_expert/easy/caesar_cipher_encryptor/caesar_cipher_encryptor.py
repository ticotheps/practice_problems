"""
CAESAR CIPHER ENCRYPTOR

Given a non-empty string of lowercase letters and a non-negative integer
representing a key, write a function that returns a new string obtained by
shifting every letter in the input string by k positions in the alphabet, where
k is the key.

NOTE:
    - Letters should "wrap" around the alphabet; in other words, the letter "z"
    shifted by one returns the letter "a".
    
Sample Inputs: "xyz", 2
Sample Output: "zab"

Hints:
    - Most languages have built-in functions that give you the Unicode value of
    a character as well as the character corresponding to a Unicode value.
    - Consider using such functions to determine which letters the input
    string's letters should be mapped to.
