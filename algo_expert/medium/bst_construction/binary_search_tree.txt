BINARY SEARCH TREES

- What is a BST (Binary Search Tree)?
  - A tree that must follow the "BST property":
    - The value of a node MUST be GREATER than the values of all the 
      nodes to the left of that node.
    - The value of a node MUST be LESS than or equal to the values of all
      the nodes to the right of that node.
    - All children nodes of the node in the BST MUST also follow the BST     properties.

- What methods are implemented inside of a BST class?
  - Insertion
  - Searching
  - Deletion

- Using binary search trees is very effective for finding the value of a
  given node very quickly because it allows for the elimination of half 
  of a subtree while traversing the tree.
