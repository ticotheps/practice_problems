BINARY SEARCH TREES

- What is a BST (Binary Search Tree)?
  - A tree that must follow the "BST property":
    - The value of a node MUST be GREATER than the values of all the 
      nodes to the left of that node.
    - The value of a node MUST be LESS than or equal to the values of all
      the nodes to the right of that node.
    - All children nodes of the node in the BST MUST also follow the BST     properties.
