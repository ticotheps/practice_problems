BST Construction

Write a Binary Search Tree (BST) class. The class should have a "value"
property set to be an integer, as well as "left" and "right" properties,
both of which should point to either the None (null) value or another
BST.

A node is said to be a BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST
property: its value is strictly greater than the value of every node to 
its left;
