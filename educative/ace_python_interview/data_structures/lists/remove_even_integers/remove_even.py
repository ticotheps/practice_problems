REMOVE EVEN INTEGERS FROM LIST

Implement a function that removes all the even elements from a given list. Name
it "remove_even(list)".

Input:
    - A list with random integers.

Output:
    - A list with only odd integers.
    
Sample Input:
    - my_list = [1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 6, 3]
    
Sample Output:
    - my_list = [1, 5, 3]

UNDERSTAND:
    - Objective:
        - Write an algorithm that takes in a single input list of random integers
        and returns a single output list of only odd integers.
        
    - Expected Inputs:
        - 1
        - 'list' data type
        - "list"
        
    - Expected Outputs:
        - 1
        - 'list' data type
        - "odd_list"
        
    - Constraints & Edge Cases:
        - Can the input list contain negative numbers?
            - Yes. Negative numbers are acceptable.
        - Can the input list contain floating point numbers?
            - No.
        - Can the input list be empty?
            - No. It must contain at least 1 element.
        - What happens if we're given a list and that list contains all even numbers?
            - Return an empty list.
