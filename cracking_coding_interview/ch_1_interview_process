The Interview Process

-Most interviewers are looking to evaluate your ability to solve 
 algorithmic problems you haven't seen before.

-Always talk out loud throughout the problem and explain your throughout
 process. This will help give the interviewer a better idea of your 
 problem solving approach.

-Your interviewer will make an assessment of your performance based on the
 following:
    -Analytical Skills: 
        -Did you need much help solving the problem?
        -How optimal was your solution?
        -How long did it take you to arrive at your solution?
        -Did you think about tradeoffs for certain decisions?
    -Coding Skills:
        -Were you able to successfully translate your algorithm to 
         reasonable code?
        -Was it clean and well-organized?
        -Did you think about potential errors?
        -Did you use good style?
    -Technical Knowledge/Computer Science Fundamentals:
        -Do you have a strong foundation in computer science and the
         relevant technologies?
    -Experience:
        -Have you made good technical decisions in the past?
        -Have you built interesting, challenging projects?
        -Have you shown drive, initiative, and other important factors?
    -Culture Fit/Communication Skills: 
        -Do your personality and values fit with the company and team?
        -Did you communicate well with your interviewer?

=Why do companies still do whiteboarding interviews?
    -The most common complaints against whiteboarding interviews:
        -"Lots of great candidates don't do well in these sorts of 
          interviews."
        -"You could look up the answer if it did ever come up."
        -"You rarely have to use data structures such as binary search
          trees in the real world. If you did need to, you could surely
          learn it."
        -"Whiteboard coding is an artificial environment. You would never
          code on the whiteboard in the real world, obviously."
    -The reasons why whiteboarding is still used:
        -False negatives are acceptable.
        -Problem-solving skills are valuable.
        -Basic data structure and algorithm knowledge is useful.
        -Whiteboards let you focus on what matters.
