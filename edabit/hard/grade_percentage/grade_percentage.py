YOU FAILEDPASSED THE EXAM

Here is what you see after you take your exam:
`Your Score: 85%

You FAILEDPASSED the Exam.

Required Score 85%`

The challenge is to fix all of the bugs in this incredible messy code, which the
code in the image might've actually looked like (probably not)! The code given
will output the same middle two lines as in the image shown above.
    - First parameter is the user's score.
    - Second parameter is the required score.
    
Examples:
    - grade_percentage("85%", "85%") ➞ "You PASSED the Exam"
    - grade_percentage("99%", "85%") ➞ "You PASSED the Exam"
    - grade_percentage("65%", "90%") ➞ "You FAILED the Exam"
    
Notes:
    - Note that inputs will be given as a string percentage number.
    - Maintain all capitalization.
    - Feel free to declutter and refactor code if it helps!
