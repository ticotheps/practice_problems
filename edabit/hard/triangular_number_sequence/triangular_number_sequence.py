TRIANGULAR NUMBER SEQUENCE

This triangular number sequence is generated from a pattern of dots that form a
triangle. The first 5 numbers of the sequence, or dots, are:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15

This means that the first triangle has just one dot, the second one has three
dots, the third one has six dots, and so on.

Write a function that gives the number of dots, 'n', with its corresponding
triangle number of the sequence.

Examples:
    - triangle(1) -> 1
    - triangle(6) -> 21
    - triangle(215) -> 23220

PHASE I: UNDERSTAND

- Objective: 
    - Write an algorithm that takes in a single input triangle number, 'n', and
    returns a single output, 'num_of_dots' (an integer).
      
- Expected Input:
    - Data Type: integer
    - Var Name: 'n'
    
- Expected Output:
    - Data Type: integer
    - Var Name: 'num_of_dots'
    
- Edge Cases & Constraints:
    - Can the input integer be negative?
        - No.
    - Can the input be a floating point number?
        - No.
    - How would you handle an input of "None"?
        - Return a string that says, "Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer."
