TRIANGULAR NUMBER SEQUENCE

This triangular number sequence is generated from a pattern of dots that form a
triangle. The first 5 numbers of the sequence, or dots, are:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15

This means that the first triangle has just one dot, the second one has three
dots, the third one has six dots, and so on.

Write a function that gives the number of dots, 'n', with its corresponding
triangle number of the sequence.

Examples:
    - triangle(1) -> 1
    - triangle(6) -> 21
    - triangle(215) -> 23220
