FIND THE PRIMORIAL

A 'Primorial' is a product of the first n prime numbers (e.g. - 2 x 3 x 5 = 30).
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 are prime numbers. If n was 3, you'd multiply 2 x 3 x 5 = 30
or 'Primorial' = 30.

Create a function that returns the Primorial of a number.

Examples:
    - get_primorial(1) -> 2
    - get_primorial(2) -> 6
    - get_primorial(8) -> 9699690

PHASE I - UNDERSTAND

Defining Terms:
    - 'Primorial': the product of 'n' number of consecutive prime numbers,
    beginning with 2 as the first prime number.

Objective:
    - Write an algorithm that takes in a single input, 'num', and returns a
    single output, 'primorial', for that number.
    
Expected Input(s):
    - Number Of: 1
    - Data Type(s): integer
    - Var Name(s): 'num'
    
Expected Output(s):
    - Number Of: 1
    - Data Type(s): integer
    - Var Name(s): 'primorial'
    
Constraints:
    - Can the input 'num' be negative?
        - No, because it refers to a specific number of prime numbers in a sequence
        and prime numbers must be positive.
    - Can the input 'num' be a floating point number?
        - No, because it refers to a specific number of prime numbers in a sequence
        and prime numbers must be whole.
    - Can the input 'num' be null?
        - No.
