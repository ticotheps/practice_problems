ALPHABET SOUP

Create a function that takes in a string and returns a string with its letters
in alphabetical order.

Examples:
    - alphabet_soup("hello") ➞ "ehllo"
    - alphabet_soup("edabit") ➞ "abdeit"
    - alphabet_soup("hacker") ➞ "acehkr"
    - alphabet_soup("geek") ➞ "eegk"
    - alphabet_soup("javascript") ➞ "aacijprstv"
    
Notes:
    - You can assume numbers and punctuation symbols won't be included in test
    cases. You'll only have to deal with single word, alphabetic characters.
