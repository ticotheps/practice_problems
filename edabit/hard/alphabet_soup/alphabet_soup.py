ALPHABET SOUP

Create a function that takes in a string and returns a string with its letters
in alphabetical order.

Examples:
    - alphabet_soup("hello") ➞ "ehllo"
    - alphabet_soup("edabit") ➞ "abdeit"
    - alphabet_soup("hacker") ➞ "acehkr"
    - alphabet_soup("geek") ➞ "eegk"
    - alphabet_soup("javascript") ➞ "aacijprstv"
    
Notes:
    - You can assume numbers and punctuation symbols won't be included in test
    cases. You'll only have to deal with single word, alphabetic characters.

PHASE I: UNDERSTAND

- Objective(s): 
    - Write an algorithm that takes in a string (of alphabetic characters only)
      and returns a new string with all of the letters from the given input in 
      alphabetized order.
      
- Expected Input:
    - Number Of: 1
    - Data Type: string
    - Var Name: 'str'
    
- Expected Output:
    - Number Of: 1
    - Data Type: string
    - Var Name: 'new_str'
    
- Edge Cases & Constraints:
    - Can the given input be an empty string?
        - No.
    - Can the given input string include non-alphabetic characters?
        - No. Assume that the characters in the given input will only be
          alphabetic characters.
