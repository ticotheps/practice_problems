PURGE AND ORGANIZE

Given a list of numbers, write a function that returns a list that...

1. has all duplicate elements removed.
2. is sorted from least to greatest value.

Examples:
    - unique_sort([1, 2, 4, 3]) -> [1, 2, 3, 4]
    - unique_sort([1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2]) -> [1, 2, 3, 4]
    - unique_sort([6, 7, 3, 2, 1]) -> [1, 2, 3, 6, 7]

U.P.E.R. PROBLEM-SOLVING FRAMEWORK

PHASE I: UNDERSTAND

- Objective:
    - Write an algorithm that takes in a single input (a list) and returns an
      output (also a list) that removes any duplicate elements from the list,
      while also sorting its values from least to greatest.
      
- Expected Input(s):
    - Number Of: 1
    - Data Type(s): list
    - Var Name(s): 'lst'
    
- Expected Output(s):
    - Number Of: 1
    - Data Type(s): list
    - Var Name(s): 'lst'
    
- Constraints:
    - Can the elements of the input 'lst' be negative?
        - Yes.
    - Can the elements of the input 'lst' be floating point numbers?
        - Yes.
    - Can the input 'lst' be empty?
        - Yes. We will return an empty list as the output if this is the case.
