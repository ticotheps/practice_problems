THE MUSEUM OF INCREDIBLY DULL THINGS

A museum wants to get rid of some exhibitions. Katya, the interior architect,
comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibitions. She gives them a
rating, and removes the one with the lowest rating. Just as she finishes rating
the exhibitions, she's called off to an important meeting. She asks you to write
a program that tells her the ratings of the items after the lowest one is
removed.

Create a function that takes a list of integers and removes the smallest value.

Examples:
    - remove_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) -> [2, 3, 4, 5]
    - remove_smallest([5, 3, 2, 1, 4]) -> [5, 3, 2, 4]
    - remove_smallest([2, 2, 1, 2, 1]) -> [2, 2, 2, 1]
    
Notes:
    - Don't change the order of the left over items.
    - If you get an empty list, return an empty list (i.e. - "[]" -> "[]").
    - If there are multiple items with the same value, remove the item with the
    lower index (i.e. - look at the 3rd example above).
