"""
Repeating Letters
    - Objective: Create a function that takes in an input [of string data type]
    and returns an output [of string data type] in which each item in the string
    is repeated ONCE.
    
    - Examples:
        - double_char("String") ➞ "SSttrriinngg"
        - double_char("Hello World!") ➞ "HHeelllloo  WWoorrlldd!!"
        - double_char("1234!_ ") ➞ "11223344!!__  "
        
    - Constraints:
        - All test cases contain valid strings. 
        - Don't worry about spaces, special characters or numbers. 
            - They're all considered valid characters.

    # Create a var 'newDoubleCharsList' that is set equal to an empty list.
    
    # Create a var 'txtCharsList' that converts the input into a list of chars.

        # Append 'newDoubleChar' to the value of 'newDoubleCharsList'
        
    # Create a var 'newDoubleCharsStr' that is set equal to the string that
    # results when all of the items in the 'newDoubleCharsList' are joined
    # together.
    
    # Return the value of 'newDoubleCharsStr'
