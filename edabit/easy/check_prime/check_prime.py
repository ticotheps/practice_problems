CHECK IF A NUMBER IS PRIME

Objective:
    - Create a function that outputs True if a number is prime and False
        otherwise.
        
Examples:
    - check_prime(31) -> True
    - check_prime(18) -> False
    - check_prime(11) -> False
    
Notes:
    - A prime number has no other factors except 1 and itself.
    - 1 is NOT considered a prime number.
