ADVANCED LIST SORT

Create a function that takes a list of numbers or strings and returns a list
with the items from the original list stored into sublists. Items of the the
same value should be in the same sublist.

- Examples:
    - advanced_sort([2, 1, 2, 1]) ➞ [[2, 2], [1, 1]]
    - advanced_sort([5, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3]) ➞ [[5, 5, 5], [4, 4], [3]]
    - advanced_sort(["b", "a", "b", "a", "c"]) ➞ [["b", "b"], ["a", "a"], ["c"]]
    
- Notes:
    - The sublists should be returned in the order of each element's first
      appearance in the given list.

****** UNDERSTAND ******
- Objective:
    - Write an algorithm that takes in a single list of either all numbers or all
      strings and returns a list of multiple sublists where each sublist only
      contains elements that are duplicates of one another.
      
- Expected Input(s):
    - Number Of: 1
    - Data Type(s): list
    - Var Name(s): "lst"
    
- Expected Output(s):
    - Number Of: 1
    - Data Type(s): list
    - Var Name(s): "list_of_sublists"
    
- Edge Cases & Constraints
    - Can the given input list include a list of numbers mixed in with strings?
        - No. They must be all of one type or the other.
