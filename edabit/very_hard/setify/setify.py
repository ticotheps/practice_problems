TRANSFORM INTO A LIST WITH NO DUPLICATES

A set is a collection of unique items. A set can be formed from a list from
removing all duplicate items.

Create a function that sorts a list and removes all duplicate items from it.

- Examples:
    - setify([1, 3, 3, 5, 5]) ➞        [1, 3, 5]
    - setify([4, 4, 4, 4]) ➞           [4]
    - setify([5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15]) ➞   [5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15]
    - setify([3, 3, 3, 2, 1]) ➞        [1, 2, 3]

The 4 Phases of the U.P.E.R. Problem-Solving Framework

****** UNDERSTAND Phase ******
- Objective:
    - Write an algorithm that takes in a single input list, removes any
      duplicates, and returns a single output list that contains no duplicates.
      
- Expected Input(s):
    - Number Of: 1
    - Data Type(s): list
    - Var Name(s): "lst"
    
- Expected Output(s):
    - Number Of: 1
    - Data Type(s): list
    - Var Name(s): "new_lst"
    
- Edge Cases & Constraints:
    - Can the given input list include strings?
        - Yes.
    - Can the given input list be empty?
        - No. If this is the case, return a string that says, "Invalid input.
          Please provide a string with at least 1 element."
    - Can the elements in the given input list be negative numbers?
        - Yes.
    - Can the elements in the given input list be floating point numbers?
        - Yes.
