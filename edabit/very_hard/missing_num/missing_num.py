FIND THE MISSING NUMBER

Create a function that takes in a list of numbers between 1 and 10 (excluding
one number) and returns the missing number.

- Examples:
    - missing_num([1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) ➞ 5
    - missing_num([7, 2, 3, 6, 5, 9, 1, 4, 8]) ➞ 10
    - missing_num([10, 5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 3, 9]) ➞ 7
    
- Notes:
    - The list of numbers will be unsorted (not in order).
    - Only one number will be missing.
