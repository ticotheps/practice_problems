"""
List of Multiples
    - Objective: Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments (num, length) and returns
    a list of multiples of num up to length.
    
    - Examples:
        - get_list_of_multiples(7, 5) -> [7, 14, 21, 28, 35]
        - get_list_of_multiples(12, 10) -> [12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120]
        - get_list_of_multiples(17, 6) -> [17, 34, 51, 68, 85, 102]
        
    - Hints:
        - Note that our argument 'num' is also included in the returned list.
