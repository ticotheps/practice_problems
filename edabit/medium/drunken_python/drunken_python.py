Drunken Python

Python got drunk and built-in functions 'str()' and 'int()' are acting odd:

str(4) -> 4
str("4") -> 4
int("4") -> "4"
int(4) -> "4"

You need to create two functions to substitute 'str()' and 'int()'. A function
called 'int_to_str()' that converts integers into strings and a function called
'str_to_in()' that converts strings into integers.

Examples:
    - int_to_str(4) -> "4"
    - str_to_int("4") -> 4
    - int_to_str(29348) -> "29348"
    
Notes:
    - This is meant to illustrate the dangers of using already-existing function
        names.
    - Extra points if you can de-drunk Python.
