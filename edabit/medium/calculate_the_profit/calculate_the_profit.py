CALCULATE THE PROFIT

You work for a manufacturer, and have been asked to calculate the total profit
made on the sales of product. You are given a dictionary containing the cost
price per unit (in dollars), the sell price per unit (in dollars), and the
starting inventory. Return the total profit made, rounded to the nearest dollar.
Assume all inventory has been sold.

Objective:
    - Write an algorithm that will take in a single Python dictionary and
        return a single integer, representing the number of dollars made in
        profit.
        
Examples:
    - calculate_the_profit({
        "cost_price": 32.67,
        "sell_price": 45.00,
        "inventory": 1200,
    }) -> 14796
    
    - calculate_the_profit({
        "cost_price": 225.89,
        "sell_price": 550.00,
        "inventory": 100,
    }) -> 32411
    
    - calculate_the_profit({
        "cost_price": 2.77,
        "sell_price": 7.95,
        "inventory": 8500,
    }) -> 44030
    
Notes:
    - Profit = Total Sales - Total Cost
