Create a function that returns the number of characters shared between two
words.

Examples:
    - get_shared_letters('apple', 'meaty') -> 2
    - get_shared_letters('fan', 'forsook') -> 1
    - get_shared_letters('spout', 'shout') -> 4

Expected Inputs & Outputs:
    - Inputs:
        - Expected Number: 2
        - Expected Data Types: string, string
        - Expected Var Names: 'str_1', 'str_2'

    - Outputs:
        - Expected Number: 1
        - Expected Data Types: integer
        - Expected Var Names: 'num_of_shared_letters'
        
Constraints:
    - Can either of the inputs be empty strings?
        - No.
