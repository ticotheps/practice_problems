SUM OF TWO NUMBERS (with a twist)!

Find the sum of two numbers.


Examples:
    - sum2("5125515215521515", "125261616261626") -> "5250776831783141"
    - sum2("6666666666666666666666666666", "99999999999999999999999") ➞
    "6666766666666666666666666665"
    - sum2("123456789123456789123456789", "987654321987654321987654329876543") ➞
    "987654445444443445444443453333332"
    
Notes:
    - Remember how to sum two numbers ON PAPER; it could be useful.
    - Your function must run in less than 10 seconds because Edabit has a time
    limit.
    - Each input number can have 1000 digits (characters) in it.

U.P.E.R.

- UNDERSTAND
    - Objective: 
        - Write an algorithm that takes in two inputs (both integers that
        are represented using the 'String' data type) and returns a single output
        (an integer that is also represented using the 'String' data type).
    
    - Expected Input(s):
        - 2 expected inputs
        - both are integers that are actually of the 'String' data type
        - "num1_str", "num2_str"
    
    - Expected Output(s):
        - 1 expected output
        - an integer that is represented by a 'String' data type
        - "sum_str"
        
    - Constraints and Edge Cases:
        - Constraint #1:
            - len(num1_str) <= 1000
        - Constraint #2:
            - len(num2_str) <= 1000
        - Can either of the given inputs be negative?
            - Yes, they can be negative because the prompt doesn't explicitly
              state that they must be positive integers.
        - Can either of the given inputs be floating point numbers?
            - Yes, they can be floating point numbers because the prompt doesn't
              explicitly state that they must be positive integers.
        - Can either of the given inputs be empty strings?
            - No, because 'None' is not a number than can be added with another number.
