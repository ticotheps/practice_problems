/*----------UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM----------
- Objective 
  - Write an algorithm that returns the total number of possible routes that can be
    taken from the top-left corner of a 20x20 grid to the bottom-right corner of
    that same grid while ONLY moving in the following directions: down, right.

- Definitions
  - "grid": this is a specific 'shape' of data that is made up of an outer array
    of many smaller, inner arrays.
    - i.e. - [[1, 2, 3],
              [4, 5, 6],
              [7, 8, 9]]

- Expected Input(s)
  - Number of Expected Parameters: <number of expected parameters here> 
  - Names/Data Types of Expected Parameters
    - <name of parameter A here> (<data type of parameter A here>)
    - <name of parameter B here> (<data type of parameter B here>)

- Expected Output(s)
  - Number of Expected Outputs: <number of expected outputs here> 
  - Names/Data Types of Expected Output
    - <name of output here> (<data type of output here>)

- Constraints
  - Will the following make the algorithm fail?
    - Negative numbers?
      -
    - Number data types?
      -
    - Floating point numbers?
      -
    - Non-alphanumeric characters in the inputs?
      -

- Example #1
  - Example #1 Input(s)
    - <Example #1 input A here>
    - <Example #1 input B here>
  - Example #1 Output(s)
    - <Example #1 output here>

/*--------REFLECTING/ITERATING THE PLAN--------
- BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION ANALYSIS
  - Were you able to arrive at the correct answer with your solution?
    - Yes/No
  - Analyze the Time & Space Complexity of your solution.
    - Time Complexity: 
    - Space Complexity: 
  - Could either, Time or Space Complexity, be improved in your solution?
    - Yes/No
  - If so, how would you go about improving it?
  - What is the new Time & Space Complexity of your improved solution?
