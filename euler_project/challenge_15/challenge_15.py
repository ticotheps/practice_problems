#----------UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM----------
# - Objective 
#   - Write an algorithm that returns the total number of possible routes that can be
#     taken from the top-left corner of a 20x20 grid to the bottom-right corner of
#     that same grid while ONLY moving in the following directions: down, right.

# - Definitions
#   - "grid": this is a specific 'shape' of data that is made up of an outer array
#     of many smaller, inner arrays.
#     - i.e. - [[1, 2, 3],
#               [4, 5, 6],
#               [7, 8, 9]]

# - Expected Input(s)
#   - Number of Expected Parameters: 2 
#   - Names/Data Types of Expected Parameters
#     - "gridHeight" (integer data type)
#     - "gridWidth" (integer data type)

# - Expected Output(s)
#   - Number of Expected Outputs: 1 
#   - Names/Data Types of Expected Output:
#     - "numOfPossiblePaths" (integer data type)

# - Constraints
#   - Will the following make the algorithm fail?
#     - Negative numbers?
#       - Yes
#       - Inputs must be positive integers
#     - Integer data types?
#       - No.
#       - Inputs must be integer data types.
#     - Floating point numbers?
#       - Yes.
#       - Inputs cannot be floating point numbers.
#     - Non-alphanumeric characters in the inputs?
#       - Sometimes.
#       - Inputs must be positive integers.

# - Example #1:
#   - Expected Inputs:
#     - 'gridHeight' = 1
#     - 'gridWidth' = 1
#   - Expected Output:
#     - 'numOfPossiblePaths' = 2

# - Example #2:
#   - Expected Inputs:
#     - 'gridHeight' = 2
#     - 'gridWidth' = 2
#   - Expected Output:
#     - 'numOfPossiblePaths' = 6

# - Example #3:
#   - Expected Inputs:
#     - 'gridHeight' = 3
#     - 'gridWidth' = 3
#   - Expected Output:
#     - 'numOfPossiblePaths' = 2


# ---------------DEVISING A PLAN---------------
# - BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION (Pseudocoded Steps)
#   (1) Define a function 'findNumOfPossPaths()' that takes in 2 parameters,
#   'height' and 'width', which then returns one output, '
#   (2) <Step 2 here>
#   (3) <Step 3 here>
#   ...


# ------------IMPLEMENTING THE PLAN------------

# --------REFLECTING/ITERATING THE PLAN--------
# - BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION ANALYSIS
#   - Were you able to arrive at the correct answer with your solution?
#     - Yes/No
#   - Analyze the Time & Space Complexity of your solution.
#     - Time Complexity: 
#     - Space Complexity: 
#   - Could either, Time or Space Complexity, be improved in your solution?
#     - Yes/No
#   - If so, how would you go about improving it?
#   - What is the new Time & Space Complexity of your improved solution?
