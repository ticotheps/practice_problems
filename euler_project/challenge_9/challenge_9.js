/*----------UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM----------
- Objective: 
  - Find the "Pythagorean Triplet" for which a + b + c = 1000. 

- Definitions:
  - Pythagorean Triplet: a set of 3 "natural numbers" that have the
    following 2 characteristics:
      (1) a < b < c
        (a) three uniquely distinct positive integers
      (2) a^2 + b^2 = c^2
        (a) For the lowest 2 numbers in the set, the squares of each of
          those numbers will add up to the square of the laregest number
          in the set.
