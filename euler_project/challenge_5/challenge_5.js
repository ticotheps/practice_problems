/* ----------UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM----------
- Objective: Find the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible
  by all of the numbers from 1 to 20.

- Expected Input(s): 
  - Number of Expected Inputs: 2
  - Names of Expected Inputs: 'startNum', 'endNum' (both represent
    a range of numbers that the output can be divide by evenly)
  - Types of the Expected Inputs:
    - 'startNum' => number
    - 'endNum' => number

- Expected Output(s):
  - Number of Expected Outputs: 1
  - Name of Expected Output: 'smallestMultiple'
  - Type of the Expected Output: 'smallestMultiple' => number

- Any Constraints?
  - Can the output be negative?
    - No. It must be positive.
  - Can the numbers that define the range be negative?
    - No. They must be positive.
  - Can the numbers that define the range be floating point numbers?
    - No. They must be integers.

- Example #1:
  - Example Inputs: 
    - 'startNum' = 1
    - 'endNum' = 10
  - Example Output:
    - 'smallestMultiple' = 2520
