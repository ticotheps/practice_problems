/*----------UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM----------
- Objective: to find the 10001st prime number.

- Define "prime number".
  - a positive integer that can only be evenly divided by 1 and itself.

- Expected Input(s):
  - Number of Expected Inputs: 1
  - Type of Expected Input: number
  - Name of Expected Input: 'primeIndex'

- Expected Output(s):
  - Number of Expected Output: 1
  - Type of Expected Output: number
  - Name of Expected Output: 'primeNumAtIndex'

- Any Constraints?
  - 'primeIndex' cannot be negative & cannot be a floating point number.
  - The input cannot be 'null' or 'undefined'. We can always expect to 
    receive an input.
