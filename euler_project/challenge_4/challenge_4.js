/* ----------UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM----------
-What is a 'palindromic number'?
  -An integer that reads the same both ways (forwards & backwards).

-Expected Input(s): 
  -Number of Expected Inputs: 1
    -"numDigits" = the number of digits in each integer that are 
      multiplied together to get a product.

-Expected Output(s):
  -Number of Expected Outputs: 1
    -"largestPal" = largest palindrome made from the product of two
      3-digit numbers.

-Any Constraints:
  -Can the numbers be floating point numbers?
    -No.
  -Can the numbers be negative?
    -No.
