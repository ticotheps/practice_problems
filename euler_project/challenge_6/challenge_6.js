/*----------UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM----------
- What is a 'natural number'?
  - a positive integer that is used for counting or ordering in math.

- Objective
  - Find the difference between the SUM of the squares of the first 100
    natural numbers and the SQUARE of the sum of the first 100 natural
    numbers.
  
- Expected Inputs(s):
  - Number of Inputs: 
    - 2 inputs
  - Types of Each Input (respectively): 
    - number
    - number
  - Names of Inputs:
    - 'rangeStartNum' = defines the start of the range for our natural 
      numbers.
    - 'rangeEndNum' = defines the end of the range for our natural 
      numbers.

- Expected Output(s):
  - Number of Outputs:
    - 1 output
  - Name of Output:
    - 'sumSquareDifference' = defines the difference between the sum of 
      the squares of the first 100 natural numbers and the square of the
      sum of the first 100 natural numbers.
  - Type of Output: 
    - number

- Any Constraints?
  - Can the numbers be negative?
    - No. 'Natural numbers' are positive integers.
  - Can the numbers be floating point numbers?
    - No. 'Natural numbers' must be integers (whole numbers).
  - How high can we expect the input 'rangeEndNum' to reach?
    - Only expect the input 'rangeEndNum' to reach 100.

- Example
  - Example Input(s): 1, 10 (inclusive)
  - Example Output: 2640 (3025 - 385 = 2640)
