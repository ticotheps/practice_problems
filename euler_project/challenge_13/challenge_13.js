/*--------REFLECTING/ITERATING THE PLAN--------
- BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION ANALYSIS
  - Were you able to arrive at the correct answer with your solution?
    - Yes/No
  - Analyze the Time & Space Complexity of your solution.
    - Time Complexity: 
    - Space Complexity: 
  - Could either, Time or Space Complexity, be improved in your solution?
    - Yes/No
  - If so, how would you go about improving it?
  - What is the new Time & Space Complexity of your improved solution?
