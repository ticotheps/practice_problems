/*----------UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM----------
- Objective 
  - Sum up one-hundred 50-digit numbers and return the FIRST 10 digits of that
    sum.

- Expected Input(s)
  - Number of Expected Parameters: 2
  - Names/Types of Expected Parameters
    - "bigNumsArray" (array; made up of numbers that are stored inside of
      strings)
    - "firstNdigitsOfSum" (number; represents number of left-most digits to
      return from the sum)"

- Expected Output(s)
  - Number of Expected Outputs: 1
  - Names of Expected Output
    - "partialSum" (number; represents the first 'firstNdigitsOfSum' digits from
      the sum)

- Constraints
  - What will make the algorithm fail?
    - Negative numbers?
      - Yes.
    - Number data types?
      - Yes.
      - The numbers included in the given array are too large for JavaScript to
        handle, so they must be stored in strings.
    - Floating point numbers?
      - Yes.
    - Non-alphanumeric characters in the inputs?
      - Yes.
      - The strings included in the array must only contain numbers.

- Example #1
  - const someArrayOfBigNumStrings = [
    "123456789",
    "987654321",
    "192837465",
    "918273645"]
  - Example #1 Inputs: someArrayOfBigNumStrings, 5
  - Example #1 Output: 22222 (2222222220)
