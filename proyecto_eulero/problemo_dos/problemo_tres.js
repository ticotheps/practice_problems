/* UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM */

/*
- Expected Input(s): 
  - Only ONE expected input.
  - Type: number.
  - Can be named 'n' to represent a given number, in which you'd like to
    find the largest prime factor of.

- Expected Output(s):
  - Only ONE expected output.
  - Type: number.
  - Can be named 'largestPrimeFactor' to represent the largest prime
    factor for the given input, n.

- Constraints:
  - Define a 'prime factor'?
    - Prime Number: a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself.
      - i.e. - 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31
  - What is 'prime factorization'?
    - Prime Factorization: breaking apart a number down to its lowest
      prime factors.
      - i.e.
                75
               /  \
              3    25
                  /  \
              3  5    5 => 3 x 5 x 5 = 75
  - Can it be a negative number? 
    -
  - Can it be a floating number?
