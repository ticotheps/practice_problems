Given two strings, find the number of common characters between them.

- Example:
    - Inputs: "aabcc", "adcaa" (2; string data type; "s1" & "s2")
    - Outputs: 3 (1; integer data type; "num_common_chars")

    # create an empty array to store common strings.
    
    # use a 'for' loop to iterate through the first input string.
    
        # use another 'for' loop to iterate through the 2nd input string.
        
        # compare the characters using an 'if' statement. If they are 
        # equal to one another, then append that character into the empty 
        # array you created.
        
        # If they are not equal to one another, do nothing.
