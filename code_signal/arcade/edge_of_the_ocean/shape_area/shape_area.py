SHAPE AREA

A "1-interesting polygon" is just a square with a side length of 1. An
"n-interesting" polygon is obtained by taking the "n-1 -interesting polygon and
appending "1-interesting polygons" to its rim, side by side. You can see the
"1-", "2-", "3-", and "4-" "-interesting" polygons in the picture provided.

- Example:
    - For n = 2, the output should be shapeArea(n) = 5. 
    - For n = 3, the output should be shapeArea(n) = 13
    
- Constraints:
    - 1 <= n < 10^4
