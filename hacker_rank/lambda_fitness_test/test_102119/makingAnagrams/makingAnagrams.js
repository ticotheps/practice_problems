/*----------UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM----------
- What is an 'anagram'?
  - A coupling of two strings that contain the exact same letters, in
    the exact same frequencies, which allows for the first string's
    letters to be rearranged to form the second string and vice versa.
    
- Expected Input(s):
  - Number of Inputs: 2
  - Types (respectively): String, String
  - Names/Values (respectively): 'a', 'b'

- Expected Output(s):
  - Number of Outputs: 1
  - Type: Number (integer)
  - Name/Value: 'numOfDeletions'

- Constraints:
  - Any number of characters can be deleted from each string.
  - Characters can only be deleted from either side of the string.
  - The variable 'numOfDeletions' can't be negative or a floating number.

- Examples:
  - Inputs #1: 'cde', 'abc'
  - Inputs #2: 4 (# of deletions required for both strings to reach 'c')
