2. Matrix Ring Sum

Given an N x N square matrix represented as a 2D array, we define a ring
within the matrix to be a subset of values with indices that fall within
a ring pattern, such as the following:

a b c
d   e
f g h

A ring sum is the sum of every element that makes up a ring within the
matrix.

For example, given the following matrix:

-9 -9 -9  1  1  1
 0 -9  0  4  3  2 
-9 -9 -9  1  2  3
 0  0  8  6  6  0
 0  0  0 -2  0  0
 0  0  1  2  4  0

We calculate the following 16 ring sums:

-54,  -39,  -10,  -15,
-19,    1,   20,   25,
-19,  -13,    6,   10,
  9,   15,   27,   16

Out of all these values, the highest rign sum is 27 from the ring:

8 6 6
0   0
1 2 4

Function Description

Complete the function 'matrixRingMax()' in the editor below. It should 
return an integer, the maximum ring sum in the matrix. 'matrixRingMax()'
has the following parameters:

  (1) matrix: a 2D array of integers

Input Format

The first line contains the number of rows of the input matrix.
The second line contains the number of columns of the input matrix. Note
that these numbers will always be equal. The following N lines contain N
space-separated integers representing the matrix values.

Output Format

Print the largest (maximum) ring sum in the matrix.

Sample Input:

1 1 1 0 0 0 
0 1 0 0 0 0 
1 1 1 0 0 0 
0 0 2 4 4 0
0 0 0 2 0 0
0 0 1 2 4 0

Sample Output:

17

Explanation:

The matrix contains the following rings:

1 1 1     1 1 0     1 0 0     0 0 0 
0   0     1   0     0   0     0   0
1 1 1     1 1 0     1 0 0     0 0 0

0 1 0     1 0 0     0 0 0     0 0 0
1   1     1   0     1   0     0   0
0 0 2     0 2 4     2 4 4     4 4 0

1 1 1     1 1 0     1 0 0     0 0 0
0   2     0   4     2   4     4   0
0 0 0     0 0 2     0 2 0     2 0 0

0 0 2     0 2 4     2 4 4     4 4 0
0   0     0   2     0   0     2   0
0 0 1     0 1 2     1 2 4     2 4 0

The ring with the largest sum is:

2 4 4 
0   0
1 2 4
